# Node Book App

**_This is not a complete app._**

This app was created as a learning app.  Some of the code would be prod ready, and other would have to be update.

## Tech Used
* Node
* Express
* Express session 
* Handlebars
* Passport
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* ES6
* Bower
* Gulp



## Install

**_Again, this is not a complete app._**

If you still wish to install

Copy to your computer, either download or through some git source.

```
npm install
```

```
bower install
```

```
gulp inject
```

```
gulp serve
```

At this point you can go to localhost:3000.  

_For this app to work, you will need a local mongoDB running_

Please feel free to modify, destory, etc.  

## Extra notes
I'm using Goodreads API (https://www.goodreads.com/api).  I do have my unique key in this app, feel free to use it for dev purposes.  If you want to take it further than that, please register your own.  

I am using ES6 coding in this app.  There is no bable to compile it to ES5.  BUT the good thing they are basic ones and easily replaced with more standard coding.
